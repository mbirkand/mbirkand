## Learning Outcomes
## Artefacts
## Reflections

Criteria	Example 1 - Experience	Example 2 - Learning
What? (Description – the shortest part of your reflection)

Experience

What happened?
Who was involved?
 Learning

On what concept/idea/theory am I reflecting?
Specific tasks were shared out amongst members of my team. Initially, however, the tasks were not seen as equally difficult by all team members.

At secondary school I discovered that enquirybased learning was replaced with rote textbook learning and I struggled to adapt academically. Some of my peers found this transition straightforward but it took me some years to master. 
So what? (Interpretation – now you analyse)

Experience

What is the most important/interesting/relevant/useful aspect of the event or situation?
How can it be explained? Why did it happen?
How is it similar to and/or different from others?
Learning

What is most important / interesting / relevant / useful, or even challenging, aspect of the idea / concept / theory?
Does it tie in with anything I learned in the past? 
Has this changed the way I think, or confirmed something I already knew?
Cooperation between group members was at risk because of this perception of unfairness. Social interdependence theory recognises a type of group interaction called ‘positive interdependence’, meaning cooperation (Johnson & Johnson, 1993, cited by Maughan & Webb, 2001), and many 

studies have demonstrated that “cooperative learning experiences encourage higher achievement” 


(Maughan & Webb, 2001). 




Reflecting on my prior learning I can recall many instances where my learning could be described in terms of assimilation and accommodation. For instance, in the science classroom I was often presented with new concepts that either reflected my past experience and were assimilated into my understanding (e.g. Galilean gravity: objects of different mass fall at the same rate) or contradicted my past experience and were accommodated into my understanding (e.g.

Einsteinian gravity: objects in in free-fall can be considered stationary).

What next? (Outcome)
Experience

What have I learned?
What would I do differently next time?
Learning

What else do I need to find out?
How can it be applied in the future, even in my professional life?
 Ultimately, our group achieved a successful outcome, but to improve our achievement, we perhaps needed a chairperson to help encourage cooperation when tasks were being shared out. In future group work (on the course and at work), I would probably suggest this.	 It is important to remember in the classroom environment, therefore, that learning is not simply the act of acquiring knowledge, but is the process of interacting with, enquiring about and ultimately understanding the world in which we live.
